    "Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rather than relying on a rigid map-then-reduce format, its engine can execute a more general directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operators.\n",
    "2. it complements this capability with a rich set of transformations that enable users to express computation more naturally.\n",
    "3. Spark extends its predecessors with in-memory processing.\n",
    "4. Sitting atop the JVM, it can take advantage of many of the operational and debugging tools built for the Java stack.\n",
    "5. Spark boasts strong integration with the variety of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem."
